      "description": "BlackRock's tokenized $2.5 billion money market fund BUIDL is accepted as off-exchange collateral on Binance and launches on BNB Chain, boosting institutional trading.",
      "content": "BlackRock's $2.5 billion Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), tokenized and backed by U.S. Treasury bills, is now integrated as eligible off-exchange collateral on Binance for institutional traders. This allows institutions to hold BUIDL tokens with third-party custodians while accessing Binance liquidity for trading. Additionally, BUIDL has launched a new share class on BNB Chain, expanding its blockchain presence beyond Ethereum and others. The fund has about 93 holders, averaging a 3.7% annualized yield recently. This move bridges traditional finance and crypto markets by enabling regulated, yield-bearing real-world assets as collateral in digital markets.",
